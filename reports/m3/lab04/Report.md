# Lab 4: Placement and Route with IC Compiler II

## The concepts

1. Placement: After the floorplan is established, placement involves positioning individual cells or components within the defined areas. The goal is to optimize for performance, area, and power consumption while ensuring that the components are close enough to minimize signal delay.
2. Routing: After placement, routing connects the components using metal layers to form the necessary electrical connections. The routing process aims to minimize the length of the connections, reduce congestion, and avoid signal integrity issues.

## Practical part

### 1. Move to the working directory lab04/pnr

```tcl
cd $HOME/icdesign/m3/lab04/pnr
source /home/tools/synopsys/env.sh
```

### 2. Run the floorplan

```tcl
icc2_shell -f scripts/floorplan.tcl 2>&1 | tee run.log
```

### 3.Open the floorplaned design

```tcl
# Run ICC2 with GUI
icc2_shell -gui
# Open the library and the floorplaned design
source ../common/common.tcl
open_lib $ARC_TOP
copy_block -from_block 06_${DESIGN_NAME}_floorplan_pns_finish -to 07_${DESIGN_NAME}_place_start
open_block  07_${DESIGN_NAME}_place_start
# Run the checking
report_lib $ARC_TOP
```

### 4. Placement

**Configure options related to timing analysis and placement**

```tcl
# time.disable_recovery_removal_checks: This option controls whether recovery checks
# (which ensure that signals are stable before they are sampled) are removed
# during timing analysis.
set_app_options -name time.disable_recovery_removal_checks -value false

# time.disable_case_analysis: This option determines whether
# case analysis (which considers different signal states)
# is disabled during timing analysis. Setting this to false
# means that case analysis will be enabled,
# allowing the tool to consider different scenarios for signal states,
# which is important for accurate timing analysis.
set_app_options -name time.disable_case_analysis -value false

# place.coarse.continue_on_missing_scandef: This option controls
# whether the placement process should continue even if a scan definition
# (used for testing and verification) is missing.
# Setting this to true allows the placement process to proceed without halting due
# to the absence of a scan definition, which can be useful in early design stages
# or when the scan definition is not critical.
set_app_options -name place.coarse.continue_on_missing_scandef -value true

# opt.common.user_instance_name_prefix: This option specifies a prefix
# for user-defined instances in the design. Setting this to place means
# that all user instances will be prefixed with "place," which can help in
# organizing and identifying instances related to the placement phase.
set_app_options -name opt.common.user_instance_name_prefix -value place
```

**Perform placement, routing and timing optimizations**

```tcl
# Placement, routing and timing optimizations are performed in the multi_corner_multi_mode bases
source scripts/mcmm.tcl
```

The content of `scripts/mcmm.tcl`

```tcl
# There commands remove all previously defined corners, modes, scenarios
remove_corners -all
remove_modes -all
remove_scenarios -all

# This command creates two corners named "slow", "flast",
# which typically represents the worst-case and best-case timing conditions for the design.
create_corner slow
create_corner fast

# Reads parasitic technology data from a specified files and associates it with layer maps.
# In the first command, the data is named tlup_max, which likely represents
# the maximum parasitic effects for the fast corner. The second represents for
# the minimum parasitic effects.
read_parasitic_tech -tlup $Tlup_max_file -layermap $Map_file -name tlup_max
read_parasitic_tech -tlup $Tlup_min_file -layermap $Map_file -name tlup_min


# This command sets the parasitic parameters for the fast corner using the minimum parasitic
# specifications (tlup_min). It defines how the design will behave under fast conditions.
set_parasitics_parameters -early_spec tlup_min -late_spec tlup_min -corners {fast}
# Similar to the previous command, it defines how the design will behave under slow conditions.
set_parasitics_parameters -early_spec tlup_max -late_spec tlup_max -corners {slow}

# Modes are different operational states of the design, such as functional or test modes,
# which can affect timing analysis. This command creates a mode named "func,"
# which typically represents the functional operational state of the design.
create_mode func
# This command sets the current operational mode to "func," indicating that
# subsequent commands will be executed in the context of the functional mode.
current_mode func

# Scenarios combine modes and corners to represent specific conditions
# under which the design will be analyzed. There commands create scenarios,
# which combines the functional mode with the fast corner and
# functional mode with the slow corner.
create_scenario -mode func -corner fast -name func_fast
create_scenario -mode func -corner slow -name func_slow

# This command sets the current scenario to "func_fast," indicating that subsequent commands
# will be executed in the context of this scenario.
current_scenario func_fast
# This command reads the design constraints from the specified SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) file
# in the context of the fast scenario.
read_sdc $DESIGN_CONSTRAINT_FILE

# Similar to the previous commands
current_scenario func_slow
read_sdc $DESIGN_CONSTRAINT_FILE
```

**Initiates the placement optimization process**

This command optimizes the placement of cells in the design based on the current settings and constraints. It aims to improve performance, area, and power consumption by rearranging the positions of the components.

```tcl
place_opt
```

![Design view after placement 1](images/design-view-after-placement-1.png "Design view after placement 1")

![Design view after placement 2](images/design-view-after-placement-2.png "Design view after placement 2")

### 5. Legalize cell placement

To ensure that the placement of cells (standard cells, macros, etc.) adheres to the design rules and constraints defined by the technology being used. The `legalize_placement` command will does:

1. Compliance with Design Rules
2. Adjusting Cell Positions
3. Optimization

```tcl
legalize_placement
```

**Some log reports**

Total Violations: There are 0 violations reported in the design, indicating that the design complies with the specified placement and routing rules.

#### The estimated QoR for the design must meet the requirements

As we see in the [place.qor.rpt](#report-overview-placeqor) and [place.qor_snapshot.rpt](#report-overview-placeqor_snapshotrpt). There is no violation in this design.

#### Logical, physical libraries and TLU+ files must be provided.

As we did by the `source ../common/common.tcl` command in the [`Open the floorplaned design`](#3open-the-floorplaned-design). The `common.tcl` file declares all the libraries used by the IC II compiler, they are:

1. Logical Libraries

Logical libraries contain the logical representations of the cells used in the design, including their timing and functional characteristics. In the `common.tcl` file, the following entries represent logical libraries:

- **Standard Cell Library**:

  ```tcl
  set STD_CELL_LIB "${DESIGN_REF_PATH}/stdcell_rvt/db_nldm/saed14rvt_tt0p8v25c.db"
  ```

  - This file contains the logical definitions and timing information for the standard cells used in the design.

- **RAM Library**:
  ```tcl
  set RAM_LIB "${DESIGN_REF_PATH}/sram/logic_synth/dual/saed14sram_tt0p8v25c.db"
  ```
  - This file contains the logical definitions and timing information for the SRAM cells used in the design.

2. Physical Libraries

Physical libraries provide the physical characteristics of the cells, including layout information and design rules. In the `common.tcl` file, the following entries represent physical libraries:

- **Technology Files**:

  ```tcl
  set Tech_file "${DESIGN_REF_MW_PATH}/saed14nm_1p9m_mw.tf"
  ```

  - This file contains technology-specific information, including design rules and layer information.

- **GDS File for Standard Cells**:
  ```tcl
  set Std_cell_gds "${DESIGN_REF_LIB_PATH}/stdcell_rvt/gds/saed14rvt.gds"
  ```
  - This GDS file contains the geometric layout of the standard cells.

3. TLU+ Files

TLU+ (Timing Library Update) files provide timing information for the cells in a format that can be utilized by synthesis and timing analysis tools. In the `common.tcl` file, the following entries represent TLU+ files:

- **Timing Library Update Files**:

  ```tcl
  set Tlup_max_file "${DESIGN_REF_RC_PATH}/max/saed14nm_1p9m_Cmax.tluplus"
  set Tlup_min_file "${DESIGN_REF_RC_PATH}/min/saed14nm_1p9m_Cmin.tluplus"
  ```

  - These files contain updated timing information for the cells under different conditions (maximum and minimum).

#### Verify that the clock sources are correctly defined

```tcl
# This command provides a detailed analysis of the clock tree synthesis (CTS) for the design.
# This log includes information about clock definitions, reference cells, skew balancing,
# multi-voltage considerations, capacitance and transition constraints,
# and any other issues that may affect the clock tree
check_clock_trees
```

      Power       : 1.00pW
      Length      : 1.00um
   ```

   - The log specifies the units used for various measurements, which is standard for clarity in timing and electrical characteristics.

3. **Clock Definitions & Propagation Summary**:

   ```
   ---------------------------------------------
   Clock Definitions & Propagation
   ---------------------------------------------
   CTS-002       0         None      There are active CTS scenarios with no clock definition.
   CTS-004       0         None      There are generated clocks that cannot be reached by their master clock.
   CTS-005       0         None      Generated clocks defined on bidirectional pins
   CTS-019       0         None      Clocks propagate to output ports
   CTS-905       0         None      There are clocks with no sinks
   CTS-906       0         None      There are sinks with no clock
   CTS-907       0         None      There are disabled timing arcs in the clock network
   ```

   - All counts are **0**, indicating that there are no issues related to clock definitions and propagation. Specifically:
     - No active scenarios lack clock definitions.
     - No generated clocks are unreachable.
     - No clocks are defined on bidirectional pins.
     - Clocks propagate correctly to output ports.
     - No clocks are without sinks, and no sinks are without clocks.

4. **Reference Cells Summary**:

   ```
   ---------------------------------------------
   Reference Cells
   ---------------------------------------------
   CTS-007       0         None      Failed to specify any clock buffers or inverters for CTS

# This sets the target skew for the clock tree to 0.1 ns. Skew refers to the difference
# in arrival times of the clock signal at different points in the circuit.
# Setting a target skew helps ensure that the clock signal arrives at all relevant points
# within the specified timing margin, which is critical for synchronous circuit operation.
set_clock_tree_options -clocks [all_clocks] -target_skew 0.1
```

#### Set reference cells for clock tree synthesis

```tcl
# This command indicates that the specified cells will be recognized as valid components
# for use in the clock tree synthesis(CTS) process.
set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts { \
                 */SAEDRVT14_INV_1 \
                 */SAEDRVT14_INV_2 \

```

**Command Breakdown**

1. **`set_lib_cell_purpose`**:

   - This is the main command used to define or modify the purpose of specific library cells within the design environment. The purpose of a cell can dictate how it is treated during various design processes, such as synthesis, placement, and clock tree synthesis.

2. **`-include cts`**:

   - This option specifies that the purpose being set is related to clock tree synthesis (CTS). By including `cts`, the command indicates that the specified cells will be recognized as valid components for use in the clock tree synthesis process.

3. **`{ ... }`**:

   - The curly braces `{ ... }` enclose a list of cell names that are being defined or modified. Each cell listed within the braces will have its purpose set to be included in the CTS process.

4. **Cell Names**:
   - The list of cells specified includes various types of inverters and buffers from the library:
     - **Inverters**:
       - `*/SAEDRVT14_INV_*`
     - **Buffers**:
       - `*/SAEDRVT14_BUF_*`
   - The asterisk (`*`) before the cell names indicates that these cells can be found in any library path, allowing for flexibility in locating the cells within the design environment.

**Purpose of the Command**

The purpose of this command is to ensure that the specified inverters and buffers are recognized as valid components for the clock tree synthesis process. By setting their purpose to include CTS, the design tools will consider these cells when constructing the clock tree, allowing for proper buffering and signal integrity management in the clock distribution network.

**Importance in Clock Tree Synthesis**

- **Inverters and Buffers**: Inverters and buffers are critical in clock tree synthesis as they help manage signal integrity, drive strength, and timing characteristics of the clock signal. Properly including them in the CTS process ensures that the clock tree can be optimized for performance and reliability.
- **Flexibility**: By using the `set_lib_cell_purpose` command, designers can customize which cells are available for use in the CTS process, allowing for better control over the design's clock distribution strategy.

**Summary**

In summary, the command `set_lib_cell_purpose -include cts { ... }` is used to designate specific inverters and buffers as valid components for clock tree synthesis. This helps ensure that the clock distribution network is effectively designed, maintaining signal integrity and meeting timing requirements during the synthesis process.

#### Apply the clock tree settings

```tcl
# This command sets clock uncertainty for all clocks
set_clock_uncertainty 0.1 [all_clocks]

# This command is used to define a new routing rule that specifies the spacing requirements
# for different metal layers:
#     - M2 0.3: The spacing between clock signals in metal layer 2 (M2) must be at least 0.3 micrometers (Âµm).
#     - M3 0.5: The spacing between clock signals in metal layer 3 (M3) must be at least 0.5 Âµm.
#     - M4 0.7: The spacing between clock signals in metal layer 4 (M4) must be at least 0.7 Âµm.
create_routing_rule CLK_SPACING -spacings {M2 0.3 M3 0.5 M4 0.7}

# This command applies the previously defined clock spacing rules to specific routing layers.
set_clock_routing_rules -rules CLK_SPACING -min_routing_layer M2 -max_routing_layer M4

# This command generates a report of the current clock settings in the design.

- **Design Name**: `07_i2c_master_top_place_start`
- **Date of Report**: **Mon Oct 7, 2024**
- **Clock Configurations**:
  - **Max Transition**: **0.500 ns** (default for both corners)
  - **Max Capacitance**: **600.000 fF** (default for both corners)
  - **Target Skew**: **0 ns** (fast), **0.100 ns** (slow)
- **Routing Rules**:
  - **Global Rule**: `CLK_SPACING` applied for clock signal spacing between layers M2 and M4.
- **Buffers and Inverters**: Lists of available buffers and inverters with their respective areas and load capabilities.
- **Spacing Rules**: No additional spacing rules specified beyond the `CLK_SPACING` rule.

#### Perform clock tree synthesis

```tcl
# This sets the prefix for user instance names to "clock". As a result, any instances created
# during the design process that are related to clocks will have names prefixed with "clock".
# For example, an instance might be named clock_buffer_1 or clock_inv_2.
set_app_options -name opt.common.user_instance_name_prefix -value clock

# I don't known why we need to run this command again
# TODO: find the answer to this
source scripts/mcmm.tcl

# This command performs clock optimization and will focus on the clock path associated with build_clock
# I don't unerstand the -from and to -to option, what does they do?
# TODO: find the answer to this
clock_opt -from build_clock -to build_clock
```

### 8. Clock tree synthesis report

```tcl
# This sets the location where snapshots will be stored
set_app_option -name time.snapshot_storage_location -value "./"

# This command is used to capture the current state of the design's QoR metrics,
# which can include timing, area, power, and other performance indicators.
# The digit is set to 4, which means that the snapshot will report values
# with four significant digits of precision.
create_qor_snapshot -name clock_pre_route -significant_digits 4

# This command generates a report of the QoR snapshot created earlier.
report_qor_snapshot -name clock_pre_route > reports/clock_pre_route.qor_snapshot.rpt

# This command generates a comprehensive report that includes various QoR metrics
# such as timing, area, and power.
report_qor > reports/clock_pre_route.qor

# This command generates a report detailing the constraints applied to the design
# and any violations that may exist.
report_constraints -all_violators > reports/clock_pre_route.con

# This command generates a timing report focusing on maximum delay characteristics.
# That includes capacitance information, transition time information for the signals,
# details about the input pins, information about the nets in the design.
report_timing -capacitance -transition_time -input_pins -nets -delay_type max > reports/clock_pre_route.max.tim

# Similar to the previous command, but it focusing on minimum delay
report_timing -capacitance -transition_time -input_pins -nets -delay_type min > reports/clock_pre_route.min.tim

### 9. Clock tree synthesis optimization

```tcl
# Sets the instance name prefix to "clock." Instances related to clock signals
# will have names prefixed with "clock."
set_app_options -name opt.common.user_instance_name_prefix -value clock

# This command performs clock optimization start from the clock signal or tree named route_clock
# and end at the clock signal or tree named final_opto
clock_opt -from route_clock -to final_opto
```

#### Explain concepts

In the IC Compiler II (ICC2) environment, `route_clock`, `build_clock`, and `final_opto` represent different stages or components of the clock design and optimization process. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each term and their differences:

1. `route_clock`

- **Definition**: `route_clock` refers to the stage in the design flow where the clock signals are physically routed throughout the design. This involves connecting clock sources (like clock buffers) to clock sinks (like flip-flops) while adhering to design rules and constraints.
- **Purpose**: The main goal during the `route_clock` phase is to ensure that the clock signals are distributed efficiently, minimizing clock skew and ensuring that the clock reaches all necessary components within the required timing constraints.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Focuses on the physical routing of clock signals.
  - Involves the placement of clock buffers and the connections between them and the clock sinks.
  - Ensures that the clock network meets design rules and constraints, such as spacing and layer usage.

2. `build_clock`

- **Definition**: `build_clock` typically refers to the initial construction or synthesis of the clock tree. This phase involves creating the clock tree structure based on the design's requirements, including the placement of clock buffers and the initial connections.
- **Purpose**: The `build_clock` phase aims to create a preliminary clock distribution network that can then be further optimized and routed. It sets up the basic structure of the clock tree before detailed routing takes place.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Involves the creation of the clock tree structure, including the placement of clock buffers and the initial connections to clock sinks.
  - Establishes a framework for subsequent routing and optimization.
  - May include initial timing analysis to ensure that the clock tree meets basic timing requirements.

3. `final_opto`

- **Definition**: `final_opto` refers to the final optimization stage of the clock network after routing has been completed. This phase focuses on fine-tuning the clock tree to ensure that it meets all timing and performance requirements.
- **Purpose**: The goal of the `final_opto` phase is to make any necessary adjustments to the clock tree after routing to optimize for parameters such as skew, delay, and power consumption. This may involve adding or removing buffers, adjusting the placement of components, or modifying the routing.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Focuses on post-routing optimization of the clock network.
  - Ensures that the clock tree meets all timing constraints and design specifications.
  - May involve iterative adjustments based on timing analysis results, ensuring that the clock distribution is optimal for performance.

Summary of Differences

- **Stage in Design Flow**:

  - **`build_clock`**: Initial construction of the clock tree structure.
  - **`route_clock`**: Physical routing of the clock signals to connect sources and sinks.

#### What is `clock repeater`

In the context of digital design and clock distribution networks, a **clock repeater** is a specialized circuit element used to enhance the performance of clock signals as they propagate through a design. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of what a clock repeater is, its purpose, and its significance:

**Definition of Clock Repeater**
A **clock repeater** is a buffer or amplifier specifically designed to regenerate and distribute clock signals within a digital circuit. It takes an incoming clock signal and produces a new clock signal that is a replica of the original, but with improved signal integrity.

**Purpose of Clock Repeaters**

1. **Signal Integrity**: As clock signals travel through a circuit, they can experience degradation due to factors such as capacitance, resistance, and inductance in the interconnects. Clock repeaters help restore the signal to its original shape, reducing the effects of noise and distortion.

2. **Skew Reduction**: Clock skew refers to the difference in arrival times of the clock signal at different components in the circuit. By strategically placing clock repeaters, designers can minimize skew, ensuring that all parts of the circuit receive the clock signal simultaneously.

3. **Drive Capability**: Clock repeaters increase the drive strength of the clock signal, allowing it to drive multiple loads (such as flip-flops and other sequential elements) without significant degradation in signal quality.

4. **Distance Coverage**: In large designs, the distance between the clock source and the clock sinks can be significant. Clock repeaters can be placed along the clock distribution path to ensure that the clock signal reaches all components effectively, even over long distances.

**Characteristics of Clock Repeaters**

- **Latency**: Clock repeaters introduce a small amount of latency, which is the time it takes for the clock signal to pass through the repeater. This latency must be accounted for in timing analysis.
- **Power Consumption**: While clock repeaters improve signal integrity, they also consume power. Designers must balance the benefits of using repeaters with the additional power they require.
- **Placement**: The placement of clock repeaters is critical. They should be positioned to optimize the clock distribution network, minimizing skew and ensuring that the clock signal reaches all components within the required timing constraints.

### 11. Routing

```tcl
# This command checks whether the current design can be routed successfully given the existing layout
# and design constraints.
check_routability

# Ignore layer M2 to layer M6 during the routing process.
set_ignored_layers -min_routing_layer M2 -max_routing_layer M6

# This command generates a report detailing the layers that have been set to be ignored
# during the routing process.
report_ignored_layers


# This command performs optimization on the routing of the design. It adjusts the existing routing
# to improve performance metrics such as timing, area, and power consumption.
# This may involve rerouting certain paths, adjusting wire widths, or modifying the placement of components.
route_opt
```

#### Report log overview: `check_routability`

Based on the log, the Design can be routed successfully.

### 12. Routing optimization

```tcl
# This command connects the power net (VDD) to all relevant pins in the design
# that are designated as VDD pins.
#     [get_pins -physical_context */VDD]: This part of the command retrieves all pins in the design
#     that are associated with the VDD net. The -physical_context option ensures that only physical pins
#     are considered, which is important for accurate routing.
connect_pg_net -net VDD [get_pins -physical_context */VDD]

# Similar to the previous command, this command connects the ground net (VSS) to all relevant pins
# in the design that are designated as VSS pins.
connect_pg_net -net VSS [get_pins -physical_context */VSS]

# This command optimizes the routing of the design to improve performance metrics
# such as timing, area, and power consumption.
#     -max_detail_route_iterations 5: This option specifies the maximum number
#     of detailed routing iterations to perform during the optimization process.
#     In this case, it is set to 5 iterations.
optimize_routes -max_detail_route_iterations 5
```

```tcl
check_lvs -max_errors 2000
```

```
===============================================================
    Maximum number of violations is set to 2000
    Abort checking when more than 2000 violations are found
    All violations might not be found.

#### Create the final report

```tcl
set_app_option -name time.snapshot_storage_location -value "./"
create_qor_snapshot -name route -significant_digits 4

# This command generates a report on the routing congestion in the design.
report_congestion

# This command generates a Verilog netlist of the routed design. It includes the power and ground netlist
